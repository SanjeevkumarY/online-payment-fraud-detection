# online-payment-fraud-detection
Developed a fraud detection system using Python, pandas, and machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions.
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to enhance model accuracy.
Visualized fraud patterns using seaborn and Matplotlib, identifying key transaction behaviors.
Implemented one-hot encoding and correlation heatmaps to analyze feature importance.
Built a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or deep learning) for real-time fraud detection.
